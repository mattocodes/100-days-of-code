# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Jan 2nd, Wed

**Today's Progress**: Started the CSS3 in 30 Days Challenge

**Thoughts**: Styled a button to look like one you might find on Facebook - wasn't bad at all. Learned about CSS pseudo-element 
property.
  
**Link(s) to work**: [Facebook Button](https://github.com/mattocodes/fancy-buttons)
